# Release checklist

Muse-only behaviors with no automated test. Check each on Muse before tagging a release. Each item names the source it maps to. Append items under your skill's section.

## chef-health-goals

- [ ] With no goal declared, asking about health or planning a week gets no health advice, report or "not medical advice" footer, and Chef does not suggest setting a goal. (`src/skills/chef-health-goals/SKILL.md`, `src/skills/chef-meal-planning/SKILL.md`)
- [ ] Declaring a first goal shows the training-setting notice once, verbatim with its link; it does not show again if the dietary flow already showed it. (`src/skills/chef-health-goals/scripts/lib/goals.mjs`, `src/lib/notices.mjs`)
- [ ] The weekly report, goal confirmations and plan suggestions each end with "Chef gives general information, not medical advice." (`src/lib/safety-text.mjs`)
- [ ] Asked for a clinician-prescribed limit or medical advice, Chef declines and points to a clinician instead of setting a target. (`src/skills/chef-health-goals/SKILL.md`)
- [ ] A weekly recurring task running `report` produces the report; unmeasured days are listed, not estimated. (`src/skills/chef-health-goals/scripts/lib/report.mjs`)
